Machine Learning Practice -- Day 8

In this code, we build three SVM models with different parameters and evaluate their performance using the accuracy score.

Model One
The first model uses a linear kernel and is trained on the training data. Then, we evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data using the score method.

The accuracy of the first model is 0.9777777777777777.

Model Two
The second model uses a non-linear kernel with a parameter C=10. Again, we train the model on the training data and evaluate its accuracy on the test data.

The accuracy of the second model is 0.9861111111111112.

Model Three
The third model uses the default kernel and parameters. We train the model on the training data and evaluate its accuracy on the test data.

The accuracy of the third model is 0.9888888888888889.

Overall, we built and evaluated three different SVM models with different parameters to predict the digits. The accuracy of the models ranges from 97.78% to 98.89%.
