Machine Learning Practice -- Day 8

The code provided is a sample implementation of a machine learning classification problem using the Scikit-learn library in Python. Specifically, it demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Classifier model for the iris dataset.

The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is loaded using the load_iris() function from the sklearn.datasets module.

Next, the train_test_split() function is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets with a test size of 20% of the data. The random state is set to 123 to ensure the same random sequence is generated every time the code is executed.

After that, a RandomForestClassifier() object is created and fitted to the training data using the fit() function. The score() function is used to calculate the accuracy of the model on the testing set.

A confusion matrix is then calculated using the confusion_matrix() function from the sklearn.metrics module to evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set.

Finally, a heatmap is plotted using the heatmap() function from the seaborn library to visually represent the confusion matrix.
