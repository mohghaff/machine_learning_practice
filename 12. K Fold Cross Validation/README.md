Machine Learning Practice -- Day 9

The code evaluates and compares the performance of several classification algorithms - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) - on the iris dataset using cross-validation.

It then performs cross-validation on each of these algorithms to evaluate their performance on the iris dataset using the StratifiedKFold cross-validation technique. StratifiedKFold is used to ensure that the dataset is split into equal proportions while preserving the ratio of the target variable in each fold. The code then computes the mean of the cross-validation scores for each algorithm and prints the results.

The results show that the Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression algorithms perform the best with mean cross-validation scores of 0.9735 and 0.9603, respectively, while the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers perform slightly worse with mean cross-validation scores of 0.9262 and 0.9401, respectively.
