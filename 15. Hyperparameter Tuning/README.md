Machine Learning Practice -- Day 11

The code demonstrates hyperparameter tuning for a set of machine learning models using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn. It aims to find the best hyperparameters for each model by performing cross-validation on the input data.

The model_params dictionary contains a set of machine learning models along with their respective hyperparameters. For each model in the dictionary, the code creates an instance of GridSearchCV and fits it on the input data to find the best set of hyperparameters using cross-validation. The clf object in the loop is an instance of GridSearchCV, which takes the model, its respective hyperparameters, and the number of folds (cv) for cross-validation as inputs.

After fitting the GridSearchCV object, the code appends the best score and best parameters of the model to a list called scores. The output of the code is a Pandas DataFrame that contains the best scores and best hyperparameters for each machine learning model in the model_params dictionary.

The output shows that the SVM model with C=10 and kernel='linear' performed the best with a score of 0.947697. The Random Forest model with n_estimators=15 performed the second-best with a score of 0.913208. Logistic Regression with C=5 performed the third-best with a score of 0.918777. The Decision Tree model with criterion='entropy' performed the fourth-best with a score of 0.808032. The Gaussian Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes models performed the fifth-best and sixth-best with scores of 0.806928 and 0.870350, respectively.
