Machine Learning Practice -- Day 6

The code provided is an example of a machine learning model that uses linear regression to predict car prices based on their mileage, age, and other features. It uses the pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries to manipulate data, visualize it, and build the model.

This code separates the data into two sets: the features (x) and the target (y). It then uses the train_test_split function from sklearn to split the data into training and testing sets. The test_size parameter specifies the proportion of the data to use for testing, and the random_state parameter ensures that the same random split is used each time the code is run.

This code creates a LinearRegression object and fits it to the training data and uses the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.It finally calculates the R-squared score, which measures how well the model fits the data. A score of 1.0 indicates a perfect fit, while a score of 0.0 indicates no fit at all.
